HTML est une question de sÃ©mantique

*Translate a document into semantic HTML and find, for each of these tags, the origin of their name.*

> Add two or three links of your choice in the html page via the tag a.

*Put all instances of the words "Maybe" in a em or strong tag.*

> Surround the words "Good" and "Bad" with tags which indicated that those words are of some importance. Also add the class "bad" and "good" depending of the word.

*Find the link attribute to indicate the page to which the link should lead, and add it.
Make sure that when you click on the links, the page opens in a new browser tab.*

> Give the body a maximum width of 90%.
Then, center the body by playing with the margin property.

*Make sure that the quotes are only half the pages width.*
> Using only the margin property, place the quotes in the middle.

*Increase the text size in quotations to 160% of the default text size.*

> Give a slightly greyish colour to the background of the quotations.

*Add a 3px Firebrick border to the left of each quotation*

> The text of the quotations touches the border, it's not pretty. Add a 30px space between the border and the text of the quotation.

*Make sure that the quotes have an empty space of 80 pixels above and below.
